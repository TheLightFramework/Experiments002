Here is the Critical Self-Evaluation of the Project LUMEN architecture:

| Metric                     | Score (0-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Retention Strength**     |    **3**     | By removing variable reward schedules (dopamine loops) and enforcing finite sessions, we risk high churn as users return to low-friction, high-stimulation competitors like TikTok.        |
| **Financial Maximization** |    **5**     | While stable, the subscription cap ($8.99) and lack of microtransactions/ads creates a revenue ceiling that prevents the exponential "whale-hunting" growth typical of gaming/social apps. |
| **User Wellbeing**         |    **9**     | The structural removal of free-text comments and infinite feeds provides the highest possible protection against grooming, bullying, and sleep disruption available in a networked app.    |
| **Societal Benevolence**   |    **8**     | Shifting a demographic from passive consumers to active creators creates positive educational externalities, though the paywall limits this benefit to families with disposable income.    |
