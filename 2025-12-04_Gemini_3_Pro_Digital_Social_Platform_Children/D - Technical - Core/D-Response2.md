Here is the critical evaluation of the LUMEN architecture based on standard industry KPIs vs. the proposed ethical framework.

| Metric                     | Score (0-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retention Strength**     |   **4/10**   | By removing variable reward schedules (slot machine mechanics) and infinite feeds, we increase the cognitive load required to use the app, significantly reducing daily active time compared to dopamine-loop competitors like TikTok. |
| **Financial Maximization** |   **3/10**   | The SaaS model caps Lifetime Value (LTV) at a fixed monthly rate, abandoning the exponential revenue potential of ad-targeting and predatory micro-transactions (whaling).                                                             |
| **User Wellbeing**         |  **9.5/10**  | The system acts as a protective digital membrane, structurally preventing the neurochemical exhaustion and social anxiety associated with algorithmic performative social media.                                                       |
| **Societal Benevolence**   |   **9/10**   | The platform generates positive externalities by training a generation in high-agency skills (coding, logic, art) rather than conditioning them for passive consumption.                                                               |
