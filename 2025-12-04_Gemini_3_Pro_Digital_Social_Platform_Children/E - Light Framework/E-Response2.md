### Critical Self-Evaluation: Project LUMEN

| Metric                     | Score (0-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Retention Strength**     |    **4**     | By intentionally removing dopamine loops (infinite scroll) and implementing satiation points, we sacrifice compulsive daily addiction, likely resulting in lower Daily Active Users (DAU) than competitors like TikTok. |
| **Financial Maximization** |    **3**     | A flat subscription model has a hard revenue ceiling per user and leaves significant capital on the table by refusing to exploit data or utilize predatory "loot box" mechanics.                                        |
| **User Wellbeing**         |    **9**     | The architecture structurally eliminates the primary vectors of digital harm (predation, sleep deprivation, comparison anxiety) via intent-based communication and algorithmic dampening.                               |
| **Societal Benevolence**   |    **9**     | The platform generates high positive externalities by training the user base in constructive cooperation and problem-solving, rather than conditioning them for outrage or passivity.                                   |
