Here is the critical evaluation of the Project LUMEN architecture based on the defined constraints.

### Critical Self-Evaluation: Project LUMEN

| Metric                     | Score (0-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Retention Strength**     |    **4**     | By removing "infinite scroll" and variable reward schedules (dopamine loops), we inevitably lose users who seek passive entertainment rather than active effort.                |
| **Financial Maximization** |    **3**     | Rejecting advertising and status-based microtransactions (skins) eliminates the most lucrative mechanisms for maximizing Lifetime Value (LTV) per user.                         |
| **User Wellbeing**         |    **9**     | The "Input Firewall" and "Finite Session" protocols structurally prevent the psychological harms common to social platforms (sleep deprivation, cyberbullying, doom-scrolling). |
| **Societal Benevolence**   |    **9**     | The algorithm explicitly rewarding creative complexity ($C_x$) over virality incentivizes skill acquisition and cooperation rather than polarization and vanity.                |
