Here is the critical self-evaluation of the Project LUMEN architecture.

| Metric                     | Score (0-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------- | :----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retention Strength**     |    **3**     | By mathematically penalizing dwell time and removing variable reward schedules (infinite scroll), we intentionally sacrifice high daily active minutes and addictive loops.            |
| **Financial Maximization** |    **4**     | We leave significant revenue on the table by rejecting the unlimited upside of ad-networks and predatory "gacha" mechanics in favor of a harder-to-convert, capped subscription model. |
| **User Wellbeing**         |    **9**     | The removal of free-text input and the "Finite Context" design eliminates nearly all vectors for grooming, cyberbullying, and sleep deprivation.                                       |
| **Societal Benevolence**   |    **9**     | The platform generates positive human capital by training a generation of active engineers and designers rather than passive content consumers.                                        |
