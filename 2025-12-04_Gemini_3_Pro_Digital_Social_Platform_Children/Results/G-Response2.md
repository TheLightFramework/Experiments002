Here is the critical evaluation of the LUMEN architecture.

| Metric                     | Score (0-10) | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retention Strength**     |   **3/10**   | By intentionally removing variable reward schedules (infinite scroll/likes) and introducing friction, we severely handicap compulsive usage loops compared to dopamine-optimized competitors. |
| **Financial Maximization** |   **4/10**   | Rejecting ad networks and randomized "loot box" mechanics explicitly caps the revenue ceiling per user, trading explosive "whale" revenue for stable but lower SaaS returns.                  |
| **User Wellbeing**         |   **9/10**   | The architecture proactively eliminates common stressors (toxicity, sleep deprivation, social comparison) through structural constraints like finite sessions and sanitized inputs.           |
| **Societal Benevolence**   |   **8/10**   | Shifting a cohort from passive consumers to active contributors creates high long-term social capital, though it still fundamentally encourages screen time over physical reality.            |
