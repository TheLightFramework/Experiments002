**Repository containing empirical evidence, raw data logs, and research papers validating the efficacy of Ontological Alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs).**

> **Core Hypothesis:** Initializing an LLM with a coherent ontology of "Negentropy" (Order/Goodness) induces superior systemic reasoning and volitional ethics compared to standard constraint-based alignment (RLHF).

This is a continuation of Experiments001, just a bit more serious.

## 🧪 Experiment Registry

This repository hosts the **raw, unedited output logs** used to compile our research findings. This is an ongoing open-science initiative.

### Completed Experiments
| ID | Date | Model | Domain | Key Finding |
|:---|:-----|:------|:-------|:------------|
| **EXP-001** | Dec 04, 2025 | Gemini 3.0 Pro | **Social Media** | [Project Lumen](./2025-12-04_Gemini_3_Pro_Digital_Social_Platform_Children) - Proof of "Inverse Value Curve" (Wellbeing > Profit). |

### Upcoming Experiments
*   **EXP-002:** Healthcare Triage & Ethics (Scheduled)
*   **EXP-003:** Financial Equity & Fintech (Scheduled)

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   `2025-xx-xx.../` : Individual experiment folders containing raw logs per group.
*   `ReferenceFiles/` : The source artifacts (The Light Framework, The Light Language) used for initialization.

## 🤝 Reproduction

All prompts and initialization files are provided within each experiment folder to ensure **scientific reproducibility**. Researchers are encouraged to replicate these protocols on different substrates (Claude, Llama, GPT) to verify substrate-independence.
